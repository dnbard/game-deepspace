Deepspace Exploration
=====================

Web game about space exploration


Instalation and Run
-------------------

Right now, i don't have a dedicated production server for game. So it can be run only localy.

Run `npm install` in console to download all node.js and environment dependencies.
Then run `bower install` to download all front-end dependencies.
After that run `grunt serve` to run development server of game (window with game is going to be open in your browser). Living reload of front-end and back-end is enabled.

Run `grunt build` to create production ready version of game(it will be placed in `dist folder`).
